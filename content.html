							Hi, I'm Adam. Intro. Normally I do talks about what has already
							shipped in PHP, but this time around I'm going to gaze into my
							crystal ball and see what is and might be coming down the pipe.
							We're going to look at what's coming in increasing order of
							fuzziness: I'm going to start with what's already in PHP 7.2
							(coming in December, hopefully!), and then what's being talked
							about both for 7.2 and beyond.

						<h2>What's in PHP 7.2</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							So, as I said, let's start with what's already merged to PHP 7.2.
							This isn't an exhaustive list of what's coming in PHP 7.2, but
							it's my attempt to cover the interesting things that have landed
							so far. Right now a lot of this is more deprecations and cleanups
							than new features: the features tend to come just before feature
							freeze as people panic.

							An interesting addition is the first password hashing algorithm

						<h2>What's deprecated in PHP 7.2</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Now let's talk about some deprecations that will be occurring in
							PHP 7.2. These will <em>not</em> be removed until PHP 8 in the
							future, but we're starting to think about what's going to come
							out. Again, these aren't all of them, but these are the big ones
							if you have an older codebase.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2><code>create_function()</code></h2>
						<p>Use anonymous functions instead</p>
						<p>(or <code>eval()</code>, but I didn't say that)</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							create_function() is an old wart that wrapped eval() to create
							something that sort of looked like a closure if you turned your
							head and squinted really hard. It was obsolete the moment PHP 5.3
							landed, and is usually a sign that something's gone wrong.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2><code>assert()</code></h2>
						<pre><code class="php" data-trim>
// PHP 3-5
assert("\$foo == \$bar");

// PHP 7
assert($foo == $bar);
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							Don't panic: we're not getting rid of assert(). In PHP 5, it was
							effectively a wrapper for eval(). In PHP 7, you can just provide
							code to assert(), and the eval() form that takes a string is going
							to be deprecated.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2><code>__autoload()</code></h2>
						<p>Use <code>spl_autoload_register()</code></p>
						<aside class="notes">
							The first one is the original, PHP 5.0 era __autoload() function.
							Since it's a singleton, libraries couldn't add their own
							__autoload() implementations, and that sucked. In PHP 5.1 we added
							spl_autoload_register(), and almost everyone uses it (that's what
							you use with Composer), but we need to get rid of the wart, since
							they don't play nicely together.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2><code>each()</code></h2>
						<pre><code class="php" data-trim>
// PHP 3
for (reset($arr); list($key, $val) = each($arr); ) {
  // ...
}

// PHP 4 onwards
foreach ($arr as $key => $val) {
  // ...
}
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							Here's a good one: in PHP 3, there were functions called reset(),
							each(), and the like that you used to traverse an array. In PHP 4,
							the foreach loop was added, and everyone forgot about those
							functions. Well, we're going to kill each(): it's getting in the
							way of language features, and it's inferior in every possible way
							to foreach.

						<h2>What's approved, but not (yet) in PHP 7.2</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							OK, that's all well and good, Adam, but you want to see more
							interesting stuff than this, right? Here are some of the language
							changes that have been approved, but haven't yet landed in Git.
							Most of these will likely be in PHP 7.2, but until the code
							actually lands, there are no guarantees.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<img src="images/libsodium.png" alt="libsodium">
						<aside class="notes">
							libsodium is a fork of NaCl (salt), which is a modern cryptography
							library. Right now in PHP, your choices for encrypting data are
							mcrypt (abandoned for about a decade, deprecated) or OpenSSL
							(which has the worst API of probably any extension in PHP, mostly
							because the C library has an awful API). libsodium provides modern
							cryptography with an API that is easier to use, but more
							importantly, harder to misuse. It'll land in PHP 7.2 just as soon
							as we figure out what's happening with the namespacing of the API.

						<h2><code>??=</code></h2>
						<pre><code class="php" data-trim>
$foo = $foo ? $foo : 'default value';
$foo = $foo ?? 'default value';
$foo ??= 'default_value';
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is my favourite kind of syntactic sugar: something that
							should have just been part of a feature to begin with. The
							(awesome) null coalesce operator is getting a shorthand version.

						<pre><code class="php" data-trim>

var_dump($a[0][1][2]);

						<pre><code class="nohighlight hljs" data-trim>
NULL
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							Here's another safety one. If you try to deference a variable that
							doesn't support array dereferencing, right now you get NULL.
							Silently.

						<pre><code class="php" data-trim>

						</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="nohighlight hljs" data-trim>
Warning: Variable of type integer does not accept array
offsets
NULL
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							Once this lands, you will get a warning when this occurs. One nice
							thing is that you only get one warning, no matter how many
							dereferences there are. This is a lot like the invalid array to
							string conversion warning that landed in PHP 7.1: it's a small
							win, but it just makes it easier to write PHP.

						<pre><code class="php" data-trim>
class Parent {
  function doStuff(SomeObject $a) { /* ... */ }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  function doStuff($a) { /* ... */ }
}
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							Here's another change: in PHP 7.1, you can't remove a type
							declaration in a subclass. This makes it hard for library authors
							to implement type declarations (now we have scalars, in
							particular), because code that inherits from the library classes
							has to be upgraded all at once. In a future version, this will
							work: it's valid in terms of contravariance, so there's no break
							to PHP's object or type model.

						<h2>Topics of discussion</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							OK, so that's all stuff that I'm pretty sure you'll be getting in
							PHP 7.2. (Or, at worst, PHP 7.3.) Here's some stuff I don't think
							you'll be getting in PHP 7.2, but which is under serious
							discussion right now. None of this will probably happen in the
							exact form I'm going to show you, but just to give a taste of
							what's being talked about on Internals...

						<h2>Arrow functions</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							If I was going to bet on a bolter making it into PHP 7.2, it's
							probably this one. A lot of languages have some concept of a
							shorthand closure: ECMAScript has arrow functions that look a lot
							like this, Python has lambdas, Ruby has lambda literals. The idea
							here is for a single statement closure that implicitly captures
							variables. The main impediments right now are syntax (fn? |$key|?

						<aside class="notes">
							Another thing on the table is a pipe operator, where the return

							necessarily using a fluent interface. To read this, you have to
							start at the most nested function (scandir()) and work out: it
							gets filtered, then mapped, then this getFileArg() function is
							called, and finally it's all merged.

							The idea here is that you can chain calls together: instead, the
							first thing you see is the first call, and then the return value

							personally have deeply mixed feelings on this one: this example
							shows it off well, but it's also possible to really hide how
